# Informations about the game

USE ARROWS FOR MOVING.

There is an itertia and Gravity , the spacecraft will not stop all of a sudden when you press the down arrow.

Everything in the background is random .

A lot of informations can be change in the file "incs/define.h" like the speed of the ship, gravity , nb of platforms etc...

Acceleration is faster that braking.

When there is no fuel available anymore the spacecraft can't accelerate of brake , only itertia and
gravity are applied to it , so you must find a platform before that case .

you can find a UML of the project in "file/uml"
